Beautifull collection of weird pets

We all know someone who has a dog or cat as a pet - you may even have
one or both of these yourself. Other people have birds, fish, hamsters
or even ferrets but pets can come in many other forms. Hereâ€™s a list of
some of the stranger critters that people have welcomed into their
families.

Throughout history, humans have domesticated all kinds of animals,
whether to use them in heavy work, such as oxen and donkeys, or to
feed themselves, like cows. Likewise, other animals have been
domesticated for recreational or affective purposes, such as cats,
dogs, and even hamsters. We keep them in our home to have company and
take care of them.

Last but not least...
