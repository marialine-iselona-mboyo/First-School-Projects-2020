ingredients
for 8 servings

2 cups flour (125 g)
1/4 cup sugar (50 g), or sweetener of choice
4 teaspoons baking powder
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 cups milk (355 mL), plus more if needed
1/4 cup butter (57 g), melted
2 teaspoons vanilla
1 egg
1 cup pumpkin puree (225 g)

Preparation
Combine together the flour, sugar (or sweetener), baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large-sized bowl.
Make a well in the centre and whisk in the milk, slightly cooled melted butter, vanilla and egg. Whisk in the pumpkin puree until smooth.
Heat a nonstick pan or griddle over low-medium heat and wipe over with a little butter to lightly grease pan.
Pour 1/4 cup of batter onto the pan and spread out gently into a round shape with the back of your ladle or measuring cup. When the underside is golden and bubbles begin to appear on the surface, flip with a spatula and cook until golden. Repeat with remaining batter.
Serve with your choice of topping.
